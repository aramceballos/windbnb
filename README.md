## Overview

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dh5iufklf/image/upload/c_pad,b_auto:predominant,fl_preserve_transparency/v1697652140/projects-images/windbnb.jpg?_s=public-apps)

This Next.js 13 Airbnb clone with Tailwind CSS was developed as part of the devChallenges Front-End Developer Challenge. It was a great opportunity to learn about Next.js 13, Tailwind CSS, and the development of full-stack web applications. I learned a lot about these technologies during the development of this project, and I also improved my skills in developing full-stack web applications. If you are interested in learning about Next.js 13, Tailwind CSS, or the development of full-stack web applications, I encourage you to fork this project and start developing on it. It is a great way to learn and improve your skills.

You can see the demo here [Demo](https://windbnb-aram.vercel.app/)
